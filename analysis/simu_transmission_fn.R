#### Transmission simulation

  ### timesv = time when sample in days from transmission
  ### mu = mutation rate
  ### npat = number of patients
  ### nruns = number of runs
  ### param_general_fit = parameters of generalised function 
  ### t0dist = distribution within source patient at time zero
  ### max_t0 = indicator as to whether to sample from t0dist or to take the maximum number of SNPs. 0 = baseline = sample. If change to 1 then use maximum number
